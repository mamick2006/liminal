They lead you far away from the main throughfares to a small laboratory in a quiet corner of the Academy. Inside, nestled in a bundle of machinery in the middle of the room, you see an orange glow emanating from what appears to be a floating geometric shape, about a meter across. The air around it seems... wrong somehow, as if reality itself is bending.
