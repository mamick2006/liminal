""But there's one last thing we need to do,"" she continues, her expression serious. ""The Entity's connection to our universe isn't completely severed. It's still holding on through the Liminality itself. We need to cut that final thread.""

""We've traced the connection,"" she explains, ""and we know where it leads. There's a space between dimensions where an Avatar of the Entity is tethering the connection. We can create a temporary bridge to that space using the Liminality, but...""

She hesitates, looking at the glowing tesseract. ""If we cut off the connection, all planets controlled by the Entity will be destroyed. The corruption will be purged, but it won't be pretty. Are you ready?""","liminal_crisis_end_continue:Nod",
