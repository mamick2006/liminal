v1.0.2
Save compatible with previous version. Can still be added to existing saves.

Features:
- Added the final boss of the not yet implemented super end-game crisis. It's not yet fully tuned or balanced, but if you want to fight it to see if you can win, run `LiminalPrepareToDie` in the console. It should be almost impossible to beat, especially on vanilla. I'll add more difficulty options to it later.

Balance changes:
- Made research progress investment scaling slightly more generous with increased credits.

Bugfixes:
- Templates can no longer have negative costs.
- Mothballed ships are no longer counted as using templates.
- You can now unmark the intel as important.

UI Changes:
- Fixed various typos.
- Changed the description of the Alcubierre drive to better match lore.
- Added an icon for the mod
- Changed the colour of the time warp effect to match the theme.
- You can mouseover the hullmod in the template screen to see its effects.

Other:
- Various internal changes.
