v2.0.0
Save compatible. Can be added to existing saves.

- Made the sound when your templates are turned off louder.
- Made attacking Invasion staging planet easier, and ships aren't recoverable.
- You'll see :)


v2.0.0
Save compatible. Can be added to existing saves.

Features:
- Adds the Liminal super end game crisis!!!!! This crisis is *very hard*, and by far the hardest modded content I know of, especially if you turn up the difficulty settings.


Other:
- Improved sound effects of intel messages, and improved the messages that showup in the campaign UI (adding icons, etc).
- Corrected some possible errors from bad string comparisons.
- Nerfed the instruction that reduces OP cost of weapons and the one that adds fighter bays a bit, for balance for the crisis.
- Changed how researcher dialog shows up.
- Fixed fighting the boss multiple times.


v1.0.7
Save compatible. Can be added to existing saves

- You no longer need to have the ability to use gates to gain access to the Liminality research. You just need to visit the academy. In exchange, the initial payment is now 30,000 credits.
- Hide hullmods that should not be visible in the codex.
- Instruction cost scales more aggressively as the level increases, instead of linearly, to balance late game slightly more. Scales with the square of the level multiplier for normal instructions, and the cube for special and logistic instructions. You might want to check how much you're spending per month, though this should only affect late game much.
- Always display instruction cost in the research screen.

v1.0.6
Save compatible. Can be added to existing saves

- Fix bug with Instruction hullmod being automatically removed incorrectly.
- Also, filled in the mod description.

v1.0.5
Probably not save compatible since it's updating to 0.98a??? Can be added to existing saves, but it's for 0.98a so I'm less sure why you would?????

Updated to 0.98a. Now compiles with Java 17.

Bugfixes:
- Added back in deprecated hullmods, for backwards compatibility. (This was actually done in a hotfix in the previous version)
- Cannot remove negative Instructions if that would exceed the maximum OP limit.

I also did a bunch of work for the super end-game crisis, which is almost done, but was distracted by 0.98a actually releasing wtf.

v1.0.4
Save compatible with previous version. Can be added to existing saves.

UI:
- Added some text when templates are empty, to give you an idea of what to do.

Other:
- Renamed AddResearchPoints to LiminalAddRP.
- Added a command to ignore current OP and per category restrictions when adding instructions to templates (mostly for development).
- Updated the version number since I forgot to update it to v1.0.3.


v1.0.3
Save compatible with previous version. Can still be added to existing saves.

Most of the changes in this version are internal, to prepare for adding the Liminal faction and crisis. Many of the changes will only be visible if you manually trigger the boss in the console.

Features:
- Added settings to control the Liminal crisis, boss and crisis difficulty, and boss computer use (to make it playable on all hardware). These settings will change a lot of how the boss and crisis work, and should provide a variety of meaningful challenges.
- Added a new Instruction effect that limits the damage you can take in a second to a percentage of your max hull.
- Liminal faction and boss ships will now use special Liminal hullmods, gaining the effect of all positive Instructions at once (strength depends on the difficulty). Since the above effect that limits the damage you can take in a second is also a positive Instruction, this provides some defense against common cheeses that could otherwise one-shot the boss.

Balance changes:
- Switched Liminal boss burn drive for microburn.
- Boss now has flux capacitators and vents, and hullmods
- Slightly increased the maximum setting for research points gained from 10 to 15.

Bugfixes:
- None?

UI Changes:
- Added hull style for Liminal faction

Other:
- Refactored how ships are randomly generated to support the Liminal faction. This refactoring includes the boss, and changes how its generated.
- Various internal changes.

v1.0.2
Save compatible with previous version. Can still be added to existing saves.

Features:
- Added the final boss of the not yet implemented super end-game crisis. It's not yet fully tuned or balanced, but if you want test your best fleet to see if you can win, run `LiminalPrepareToDie` in Console Commands. It should be almost impossible to beat, especially on vanilla. I'll add more difficulty options to it later.

Balance changes:
- Made research progress investment scaling slightly more generous with increased credits.

Bugfixes:
- Templates can no longer have negative costs.
- Mothballed ships are no longer counted as using templates.
- You can now unmark the intel as important.

UI Changes:
- Fixed various typos.
- Changed the description of the Alcubierre drive to better match lore.
- Added an icon for the mod
- Changed the colour of the time warp effect to match the theme.
- You can mouseover the hullmod in the template screen to see its effects.

Other:
- Various internal changes.

v1.0.1
Save compatible with previous version.
Balance changes:
- Credit base cost now scales with level. Added base cost to the Research tab so that you can see it increasing.

UI Changes:
- Added version checker support and changelog (that's this!)
- Rewrote hullmod descriptions. Improved padding of effects to separate them from each other.
- Removed upkeep cost display from hullmod description because it doesn't refresh upon applying hullmod.
- Augmented Instruction title tooltips, so you can see how their effects/costs scale with level.
- Added a check so you can't go above max level.
- Fixed cost scaling clipping at low resolutions.
- Added tooltips that explain why buttons are disabled when they are.
