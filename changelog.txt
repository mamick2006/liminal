v1.0.3
Save compatible with previous version. Can still be added to existing saves.

Most of the changes in this version are internal, to prepare for adding the Liminal faction and crisis. Many of the changes will only be visible if you manually trigger the boss in the console.

Features:
- Added settings to control the Liminal crisis, boss and crisis difficulty, and boss computer use (to make it playable on all hardware). These settings will change a lot of how the boss and crisis work, and should provide a variety of meaningful challenges.
- Added a new Instruction effect that limits the damage you can take in a second to a percentage of your max hull.
- Liminal faction and boss ships will now use special Liminal hullmods, gaining the effect of all positive Instructions at once (strength depends on the difficulty). Since the above effect that limits the damage you can take in a second is also a positive Instruction, this provides some defense against common cheeses that could otherwise one-shot the boss.

Balance changes:
- Switched Liminal boss burn drive for microburn.
- Boss now has flux capacitators and vents, and hullmods
- Slightly increased the maximum setting for research points gained from 10 to 15.

Bugfixes:
- None?

UI Changes:
- Added hull style for Liminal faction

Other:
- Refactored how ships are randomly generated to support the Liminal faction. This refactoring includes the boss, and changes how its generated.
- Various internal changes.

v1.0.2
Save compatible with previous version. Can still be added to existing saves.

Features:
- Added the final boss of the not yet implemented super end-game crisis. It's not yet fully tuned or balanced, but if you want test your best fleet to see if you can win, run `LiminalPrepareToDie` in Console Commands. It should be almost impossible to beat, especially on vanilla. I'll add more difficulty options to it later.

Balance changes:
- Made research progress investment scaling slightly more generous with increased credits.

Bugfixes:
- Templates can no longer have negative costs.
- Mothballed ships are no longer counted as using templates.
- You can now unmark the intel as important.

UI Changes:
- Fixed various typos.
- Changed the description of the Alcubierre drive to better match lore.
- Added an icon for the mod
- Changed the colour of the time warp effect to match the theme.
- You can mouseover the hullmod in the template screen to see its effects.

Other:
- Various internal changes.

v1.0.1

- Rewrote hullmod descriptions. Improved padding of effects to separate them from each other.
- Removed upkeep cost display from hullmod description because it doesn't refresh upon applying hullmod.

- Added a check so you can't go above max level.
- Fixed cost scaling clipping at low resolutions.
